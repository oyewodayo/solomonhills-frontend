For automatic investments, you agree that we debit your debit card (the amount you specify) directly. Your funds will remain in your SolomonHills Account until you make a withdrawal request, which will be transferred to your Bank Account upon conﬁrmation. We will generally transfer the requested funds from your SolomonHills Account to your Bank Account within 48 hours upon conﬁrmation.

                                    You can withdraw your savings and accrued interest from Buckets at the set maturity date you choose for FREE. However, you agree that you will be charged a penalty of 5% on the value of your Bucket if you initiate a withdrawal request before the set maturity date. Thereupon, the selected Bucket will be terminated and your funds and accrued interest will be paid to your registered Bank Account.

                                    Withdrawals before 90 days on Hills will not be allowed on the ﬁrst investment. You agree to leave your ﬁrst investment for the ﬁrst three months before initiating a withdrawal. Subsequently, you will be able to withdraw your investment once every 90 days, that is 4 FREE withdrawals are allowed on Hills every year. You agree that you will be charged a 6% penalty charge on the withdrawn amount for two or more withdrawal requests made per 90 days.

                                    You can request a loan of up to X2 of your total subscription at any time you are in need of money. This will attract only a 2% interest rate immediately on the amount requested and subsequently 0.4% monthly on the repayment balance. This implies that you might eventually be charged only 2% if you repay your loan within the first two months.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Depending on the amount requested, your loan payback will be spread out across 4 to 12 months and deducted from your linked debit card. To improve your credit score, you can make the payment without waiting for the automated removal.  The speed with which your loan application is approved is determined by your credit score.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    You can cancel and receive your entire life savings (subscription) back for a 3% convenience fee after a year of active subscription while you have all your accrued dividends paid, which is not recommended. This is in direct contrast to the community's objective. It's critical to have a safe landing spot if you want to get a good loan that will pay the time value of money without breaking your back.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Also keep in mind that if you act as a guarantor for a borrower and the borrower fails to pay back the loan on time, you will be contacted two weeks after the default. As a result, you are responsible for the debt of the borrower.
